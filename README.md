# Mhackers-Examples
This repository has a variety of examples to learn about different tools and practice for CTFs

Within each example folder are all files necessary to complete the challenge. If a challenge.txt file is present
it will contain context for the challenge. Each folder will have an explanation.txt file which will explain
how the challenge was created and how it can be solved. Most challenges ask you to find a flag which is in the format "flag{_flag text_}". Happy Hacking!
